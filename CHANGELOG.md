## v2024.01 (12.03.2025)

Release of the version for the analysis for the paper looking at 2023 (Forster et al., [2024](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-2625-2024)). (As always it's confusing: the paper looking at 2023 came out in 2024 and I push the tag in 2025, just before working on the new paper.)

- Process data and re-do figures.
- BerkeleyEarth
  - version data to enable comparing across years
  - add notebook to compare across years

## v2023.02 (04.03.2024)

- Save decadal means as csv, for comparability.
- No longer load TNn in main notebook.

## v2023.01 (22.02.2024)

Create a release of the version for the analysis for the paper looking at 2022 (Forster et al., [2023](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/)). (Allthough the date is 2024, the code reflects the status of the analysis in 2023 of 2022.)

* Code for the analysis of 2022.
